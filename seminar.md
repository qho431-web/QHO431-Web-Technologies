# HTML Practice Assignment for Seminar: Build a Blog Mockup

## Learning Objectives

Apply your HTML knowledge by designing and coding a complete blog homepage structure. This hands-on assignment will reinforce semantic HTML concepts, accessibility best practices, and professional code organization skills that you'll use throughout your web development journey.

**By completing this assignment, you will:**
- Practice planning website layouts before coding
- Apply semantic HTML elements appropriately
- Create accessible, well-structured markup
- Develop professional coding habits with comments and organization

## Project Requirements

### Part 1: Design Planning (Visual Mockup)

**Create a visual mockup of your blog homepage that includes:**
- Header with site title and navigation
- Main content area with at least 2-3 blog post previews
- Sidebar with additional information (about section, recent posts, categories)
- Footer with contact information or links

**Mockup Creation Options:**
- **Hand-drawn sketch**: Use paper and pencil, then photograph or scan your design
- **Digital tools**: Figma, Adobe XD, Canva, PowerPoint, or any drawing application
- **Wireframe tools**: Balsamiq, MockFlow, or similar wireframing software

**Label your mockup sections** with the HTML elements you plan to use (e.g., "Header - `<header>`", "Blog Posts - `<article>`").

### Part 2: HTML Element Planning

**Create a list mapping each section of your mockup to specific HTML elements:**

```
Example:
- Site Header → <header>
- Main Navigation → <nav> with <ul> and <li>
- Blog Post → <article> with <h2>, <p>, <time>
- Sidebar → <aside> with <section> elements
- Page Footer → <footer>
```

**Required Elements to Include:**
Your HTML must contain at least 10 different semantic elements from this list:
- `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`
- `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<a>`
- `<img>`, `<time>`, `<blockquote>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`

### Part 3: HTML Implementation

**Code your blog homepage following these standards:**

1. **Document Structure**: Include proper DOCTYPE, html, head, and body elements
2. **Semantic Markup**: Use HTML elements for their intended purpose
3. **Accessibility**: Include proper alt text for images and meaningful link text
4. **Code Quality**: Use consistent indentation and meaningful comments
5. **Content**: Include realistic blog content (you can use placeholder text)

**Sample HTML Structure:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Personal Blog</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Main site header -->
    <header>
        <h1>My Blog Title</h1>
        <nav>
            <!-- Navigation menu -->
        </nav>
    </header>
    
    <!-- Main content area -->
    <main>
        <!-- Blog posts go here -->
    </main>
    
    <!-- Sidebar content -->
    <aside>
        <!-- Additional information -->
    </aside>
    
    <!-- Site footer -->
    <footer>
        <!-- Footer content -->
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

### Part 4: Reflection

**Write a brief reflection (3-5 sentences) addressing:**
- Which HTML elements were you most confident using?
- What challenges did you encounter while planning or coding?
- How did semantic HTML help organize your content?
- What would you do differently in your next HTML project?

## Submission Checklist

**Before submitting, ensure you have:**
- [ ] Visual mockup with labeled HTML elements
- [ ] Complete HTML file with proper document structure
- [ ] At least 10 different semantic HTML elements used appropriately
- [ ] Meaningful comments explaining your code structure
- [ ] Valid HTML syntax (test in a browser)
- [ ] Written reflection addressing the prompt questions

## Learning Resources

**Essential References:**
- [MDN HTML Elements Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element) - Complete guide to all HTML elements
- [HTML5 Semantic Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element#content_sectioning) - Understanding semantic markup
- [Web Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) - Creating accessible web content
- [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) - Check your HTML syntax

**Pro Tips for Success:**
- Start with your mockup before writing any code
- Use the browser's developer tools to inspect your HTML structure
- Test your page with different screen sizes (even without CSS)
- Read your HTML aloud to check if the structure makes logical sense
- Consider how a screen reader would interpret your page structure

> 💡 **Remember**: This assignment focuses on HTML structure and semantics. Don't worry about visual styling – that's what CSS is for! Your page might look plain, but it should be well-structured and meaningful.
